# Hello-world
not entirely sure what a repository is yet...

but hey! 
I'm Shane.
Shane Bloomfield-Gibbons
I'm a 19 year old computer and design enthousiast, and here is my story.
All my life i've always been into artsy things, ever since i was a child i was always drawing.

Now during my teenage years when i turned 14 years old i got my first own PC. that's where my dream of Designing started.
From the minute i got my own computer i was on youtube looking at "photoshop tutorials" i got in to logo designing.

That year after the summer holiday i went to start studying "Graphical media" in school, after 1 year of that at school
i moved to a new school with a more in deph design study: "Digital Arts, Film and entertainment" 

That study i followed in school for 4 years, but only passed 2, after 4 years i dropped out of school because
i was burnt out, my home situation wasent too great, i was getting depressed and my art teachers had ruined my passion for art.

then, i went on to 2nd-chance-education and that is what i am doing now, I'm studying IT assistant here.

Now its summer holiday again and i have to earn money to pay for my studies in 2 months but i cant find a job...
Past few weeks ive been feeling really down and low on life. I feel like i've thrown my life down the drain.
I have nothing left, i cant make a living out of my design because i just cant do it as good as i could before anymore,
i waste my life away playing games, i failed at all my studies because i couldnt stay motivated and dedicated long enough
to succeed a year.. 


So here i am, i woke up one morning a few days ago bursting with motivation and now i'm on my own, completely alone, going to do some designing for myself, as hobby, i've decided to cut down my gaming to a minimum and instead of waste time playing games, use that time to learn to do some developping, coding, designing. MY DREAM is to get somewhere and ahve a nice carreer in what i love. and if i do not work for it now, i'll never have it. I want to change my life NOW, i want to do somethign with my life.


What am i looking for? well here i hope to learn alot about the proffesions i'm interested in and hopefully meet some people who i can get into a skype call with sometimes and get some tips and work on some stuff together. Meet some awesome people in this community.

And next year, when i've finished my IT assistant study, i want to look for an internship somewhere far from home where i can start a dream career and finally be happy in life :)

Thank you for reading!

Any help, tips and tricks you could tell me that will help me in my battle for life are greatly appreciated! 
Thanks in advance
